* Project Description
Hello, this is the readme page of my project aws-labs. This project contains labs that I use to explore and test out different aspects of the AWS cloud technology. The project is stored on gitub.
I setup the labs using the live-scripting approache. You can read more about live-scripting at [[https://github.com/andreaswittmann/live-scripting][andreaswittmann/live-scripting]]
The documentation of the labs is based on emacs orgmode and saved to orgmode files. They are published on static website hosted on AWS S3.
